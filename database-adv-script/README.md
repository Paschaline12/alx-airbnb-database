# SQL Joins Queries

This directory contains SQL queries demonstrating different types of joins:

1. **INNER JOIN** – Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.
2. **LEFT JOIN** – Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties with no reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** – Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if a user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.
